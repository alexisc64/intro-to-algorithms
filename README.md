## *Fundamental concepts* 

An algorithm is an effective step-by-step procedure for solving a problem in a finite number of steps.
Algorithms are very important to the way computers process information, because a computer program is basically an algorithm that tells computer what specific tasks to perform in what specific order to accomplish a specific task. The same problem can be solved with different methods. So, for solving the same problem, different algorithms can be designed.
Algorithms are in everything we do. 
You could consider a cake recipe an algorithm for making a cake, for example.
Or maybe to do something simple like listening music.

# **Characteristics of algorithms.** 

Finiteness: An algorithm should have finite number of steps and it should end after a finite time.
Input: An algorithm may have many inputs or no inputs at all.
Output: It should result at least one output.
Definiteness: Each step must be clear, well-defined and precise. There should be no any ambiguity.
Effectiveness: Each step must be simple and should take a finite amount of time.

*Algorithm representation*

Flow of control through any given function is implemented with three basic types of control structures:
Sequential: default mode. Sequential execution of code statements (one line after another) -- like following a recipe
Selection: used for decisions, branching -- choosing between 2 or more alternative paths. These are the types of selection statements:
if
if/else
switch
Repetition: used for looping, i.e. repeating a piece of code multiple times in a row. There are three types of loops:
while
do/while
for

Selection and repetition statements typically involve decision steps. These steps rely on conditions that are evaluated as true or false

The most common selection statement is the if/else statement. Basic syntax:
   if (expression)
      statement
   else
      statement
     
# **Types of algorithm representation**

There are different types of algorithm representation, for example:

Flowcharts: A flowchart is a diagram that depicts a process, system or computer algorithm. They are widely used in multiple fields to document, study, plan, improve and communicate often complex processes in clear, easy-to-understand diagrams. Flowcharts, sometimes spelled as flow charts, use rectangles, ovals, diamonds and potentially numerous other shapes to define the type of step, along with connecting arrows to define flow and sequence.

Pseudocode: Pseudocode is an informal way of programming description that does not require any strict programming language syntax or underlying technology considerations. It is used for creating an outline or a rough draft of a program. Pseudocode summarizes a program’s flow, but excludes underlying details. System designers write pseudocode to ensure that programmers understand a software project's requirements and align code accordingly.

The main difference between Pseudocode and Flowchart is that pseudocode is an informal high-level description of an algorithm while flowchart is a pictorial representation of an algorithm.

# *Data types and expressions*

- Numeric data types are numbers stored in database columns. These data types are typically grouped by:

Exact numeric types, values where the precision and scale need to be preserved. The exact numeric types are INTEGER, BIGINT, DECIMAL, NUMERIC, NUMBER, and MONEY.
Approximate numeric types, values where the precision needs to be preserved and the scale can be floating. The approximate numeric types are DOUBLE PRECISION, FLOAT, and REAL.

- The Logical Data Type is a special data type for data with only two possible values. These values can be construed as 0/1, true/false, yes/no, etc.

The Logical Data Type requires only one bit of storage. For a single Logical field, the left-most (high-order) bit is used. 

- Stores strings of letters, numbers, and symbols. Data types CHARACTER (CHAR) and CHARACTER VARYING (VARCHAR) are collectively referred to as character string types, and the values of character string types are known as character strings.

Character data can be stored as fixed-length or variable-length strings. 

- Data arrangement with explained and explanatory variables in different columns is preferred for more advanced experimental designs.

## **Computational data**

Variables data is data that is acquired through measurements, such as length, time, diameter, strength, weight, temperature, density, thickness, pressure, and height. With variables data, you can decide the measurement’s degree of accuracy. Variables data is normally analyzed in pairs of charts which present data in terms of location or central location  and spread

Data values that stay the same every time a program is executed are known as constants. Constants are not expected to change.
